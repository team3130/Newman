# ERRORs code for 2023
This year we are using a Swerve Drive Robot so we implemented WPILIBs Swerve Drive Kinematics classes. \

## Newman Constants are in a submodule
This code repository depends on a submodule with shared constants.
To pull the submodule into the project, assuming the project is newly cloned from GiHub, do the following:

1. `cd src/main/java/frc/robot/Newman_Constants/`
2. `git submodule init`
3. `git submodule update`

Then it should build

## Auton
For auton we decided to use PathPlanner (https://github.com/mjansen4857/pathplanner) to draw our paths and load them into code. \
Once we have the trajectory in code we made our own HolonomicControllerCommand to follow the trajecetory generated by PathPlanner including the holonmic rotation of the bot at each point of the trajectory.
